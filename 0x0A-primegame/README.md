Maria and Ben are playing a game. They have a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to n. They take turns picking a prime number from the set, then removing that number and all its multiples. The player who can't make a move loses.

They play x rounds of the game, and n can change for each round. If Maria always goes first and both of them play to win, figure out who wins each game.
